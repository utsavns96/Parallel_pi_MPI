### Calculating pi using MPI
<br>In this homework, we modify the given program to use MPI_Send and MPI_Recv instead of MPI_Reduce to collect the partial pi values from the processors and sum them up at processor 0.<br>
We write the performance metrics to txt files, and then compare the performance of our modified program to the original one which uses MPI_Reduce.
